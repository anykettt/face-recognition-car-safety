# Face Recognition System for Car Safety

This project uses facial recognition to detect and identify individuals with the goal of improving car safety systems. The system is built using Python and OpenCV, with Haarcascade classifiers for face detection.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Approximately 92% accuracy in identifying known faces
- Designed for use in vehicles to enhance driver authentication

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haarcascade XML classifiers

## Future Scope
- Integration with vehicle hardware (e.g., door lock/unlock systems)
- Alert mechanisms for unauthorized access or unknown users
