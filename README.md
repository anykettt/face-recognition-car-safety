# face-recognition-car-safety
A facial recognition system built using Python and OpenCV for use in car safety applications.
# Face Recognition System for Car Safety

This project detects and recognizes human faces using OpenCV and Haarcascade. It is designed to be integrated into vehicle systems for driver identification and security.

##  Tech Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haarcascade XML classifiers

##  Features
- Real-time face detection
- ~92% accuracy in face recognition
- Planned integration with car safety mechanisms

##  Future Scope
- Link to Arduino or IoT systems for real-time car control
- Emergency lock/unlock features based on face ID
